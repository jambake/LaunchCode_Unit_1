		// In each iteration of that loop, print

		//
		// Your code goes below here.
		
		
		
		//
		//  Some questions:
		//    1) How does the average change as your loop progresses?
		//    2) Can you write code in your loop that prints out the average only
		//         every 100 iterations, instead of each iteration?
